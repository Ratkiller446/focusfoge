- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free UI with ASCII-only display
- **Efficient Commands**: Single-key commands optimized for Finnish QWERTY keyboards

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC or Clang compiler
- ncurses library

### Building

```bash
# Build the main application
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 focusforge.c -lncurses -o focusforge

# Run the application
./focusforge
```

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Optimized for Finnish QWERTY)

#### Session Controls (Left Hand Home Row)
- `a` - Start focus session
- `s` - Stop session
- `d` - Skip current session
- `f` - Start break session

#### Task Controls (Right Hand Home Row)
- `j` - Mark current task as done
- `k` - Unmark current task
- `l` - Remove current task

#### Navigation
- `w` - Move up in task list
- `x` - Move down in task list

#### Other Commands
- `Enter` - Add new task
- `Space` - Set current task as focus task
- `?` - Toggle help display
- `q` - Quit application

### Command Line Interface

In addition to the single-key shortcuts, FocusForge also supports traditional command-line style inputs:

```bash
# Add a task
a Write documentation

# Set focus task
t Complete project documentation

# Mark task as done
d 1

# Unmark task
u 1

# Remove task
r 1

# Start focus session
f

# Start break session
b

# Stop session
s

# Skip current session
p

# Quit
q
```

## Data Storage

FocusForge stores all data in `~/.focusforge/`:

- `tasks.txt` - List of tasks with completion status
- `sessions.csv` - Log of completed sessions
- `meta` - Streak tracking information

## Testing

FocusForge includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability:

```bash
# Build and run tests
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 focusforge_test.c -o focusforge_test
./focusforge_test
```

The test suite covers:
- Core functionality (timer, task management)
- Input validation
- File operations
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Configuration

FocusForge is designed to work out of the box with sensible defaults:

- Focus sessions: 25 minutes
- Break sessions: 5 minutes
- Task limit: 100 tasks
- Terminal size requirement: 80x24 minimum

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Issues

If you encounter display issues:

1. Ensure your terminal supports ncurses
2. Check that your terminal is at least 80x24 characters
3. Try running `export TERM=xterm-256color` if colors aren't displaying correctly

### File Permission Issues

If you encounter file permission errors:

```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.focusforge/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 ~/.focusforge
chmod 644 ~/.focusforge/*
```
